The web-crawling project and the collected data on LGBT-related news are part of my under-review paper, A Journey of Inclusiveness: Mapping Emotions and Phrases for LGBTQ in Taiwanese Major News Over the Past Decade.

Details about the data processing and the paperâ€™s content will be disclosed upon acceptance."




# Repository and Components Overview
Most of this project is written in Python. Python scripts are used to construct the model, simulate the model, and analyze model outputs.

- crawler: The python code of the web-crawler of Taiwanese mass media.
- data:  A .7z file contains two JSON files with data we crawled on LGBT-related news in Taiwanese mass media from 2010 to 2021. One file includes the raw data from our initial collection, while the other provides a polished and structured version, complete with classifications.
